## [0.7.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

* Serialization: Move all variable-length items to end of encoding
  (GP [#418](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/418))

## [0.6.7] - 07-08-2025

### Changed

* Rearrange the inner PVM page admin
  (GP [#402](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/402))
* PVM pages can change access without clearing
  (GP [#404](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/404))
* Renumber host-calls [#715](https://github.com/paritytech/polkajam/pull/715)
  (GP [#408](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/408))
* `info` host call uses fixed length types
  (GP [#410](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/410))
* Accounts storage deposit offset and additional metadata
  (GP [#397](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/397)
   and [#400](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/400))
* Core assignment privileges is a sequence, one item per core
  (GP [#393](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/393))
* Most recent accumulation outputs are stored in state; Recent blocks history now stores
  the MMR roots only, the full MMR structure relative to the last accumulation is kept
  separately (GP [#405](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/405))
* New bundle size limit (GP [#407](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/407))

## [0.6.6] - 25-06-2025

### Changed

- Codebase reorganization
- Binary to JSON conversion scripts and utilities
* Extended the `fetch` host call with new variants.
* Updated numeric identifiers used in `fetch`.
* Updated numeric identifiers for PVM errors.
* PVM wrangled operands changed.
* Removed the traces `000...000.bin/json` step, as it was not a valid trace step
  and was intended to be handled specially for genesis. Since it shared the same
  format as regular trace steps, it could be ambiguous or misleading.
* Introduced an explicit `genesis.bin` file containing the genesis state and header.
* The *authorizer trace* field has been moved to the end of the accumulation
  operand encoding (C.29)

### Deviations

* `fetch` host call for protocol parameters ($\omega_{10}=0$) has been implemented
  according to this (currently) unreleased change: https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pull/414
  For the `fetch` hostcall id we're still using 18 as per GP 0.6.6. The picked
  change only concerns the value returned for w_10=0

### Extra

* Codebase reorganization
* Binary to JSON conversion scripts and utilities
* CI: ASN.1 verification
