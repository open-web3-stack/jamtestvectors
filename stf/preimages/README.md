# Preimages STF Test Vectors

## Schema

Both the binary and json formats adhere to the overarching JAM protocol ASN.1
[schema](../jam-types-asn/jam-types.asn), as well as the specific vectors
[schema](./preimages.asn) defined for these test cases.

## Statistics

A subset of service activity statistics ($Ï€_S$) updated by the STF subsystem used
to process these test vectors.

In particular the `provided-count` (p.0) and `provided-size` (p.1) items are
updated when new preimages are provided to be included in the chain storage via
the extrinsic.
